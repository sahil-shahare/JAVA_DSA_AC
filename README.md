# JAVA_DSA_AC

**Java Data Structures & Algorithms – Practice & Solutions**

A collection of Java-based implementations covering essential programming fundamentals: sums, conditional logic, loops, patterns, functions, and more—great for learning, interview prep, and coding practice.

---

## Overview

This repository houses Java implementations of basic DSA concepts and coding exercises, ideal for developers honing their skills in conditional statements, loops, pattern printing, and functional programming. These hands-on solutions serve as a practical reference for learning and interview preparation.

## Practice Topics

- **Sum** – Basic arithmetic operations  
- **Conditional Logic** – `if`, `else if`, `else`  
- **Loops** – `for`, `while`, `do-while` constructs  
- **Pattern Printing** – Classic console patterns (triangles, pyramids)  
- **Functions** – Method creation and usage  
- **Advanced Patterns** – More challenging console output problems

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sahil-shahare/JAVA_DSA_AC.git
   cd JAVA_DSA_AC
   ```

2. **Compile a Java file:**
   ```bash
   javac "1. Sum/SumExample.java"
   ```

3. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java SumExample
   ```

   (Use the correct path for the class file, e.g., `java "2. If_else/IfElseExample"`)

4. **Explore other topics:** Navigate through each folder and test different practice files.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! You can help by:

- Adding solutions in new topics (e.g., recursion, data structures, sorting algorithms)  
- Improving existing code with comments, error handling, or multiple approaches  
- Formatting code consistently (Java conventions) and organizing folders clearly
